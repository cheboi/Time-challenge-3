code splititng is an import optimization technique for react application.
 when react application runs it bundles into one file, Bundling is usefull becouse it reduces the number of http request a page can handle.

 if the file grows incresing bundle file.the app slows reducing perfomance speed.

 Code spliting allows to split an large bundle file into multiple chunks using: 
 1.Dynamic import()
 2 Lazy loading React.lasy(); this increases page perfomance of a complex React application.
